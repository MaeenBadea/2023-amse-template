# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This project investigates the correlation between weather conditions and traffic safety by analyzing how different weather conditions, including rain, snow, and extreme temperatures, impact accident rates. It analyzes accidents data from Berlin in the year 2020.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
The project aims to determine the effect of weather conditions on traffic safety, which is essential for developing effective road safety policies and measures. By analyzing the correlation between weather conditions and accident rates, the project will provide insights into the extent to which weather conditions contribute to road accidents. Additionally, the report can raise awareness about the risks associated with driving in different weather conditions. This can help reduce the number of accidents and improve road safety for all road users.
